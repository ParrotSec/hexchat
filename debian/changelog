  [ Jesse Rhodes ]

  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Take over maintenance from Jasse Rhodes.
    Thank you for all your work these years!  Closes: #844574
  * debian/control:
    + wrap-and-sort -ast.
    + Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8, no changes needed.
    + Add proper Breaks/Replaces for the hexchat-dev addition-
    + Have hexchat-plugins recommend hwdata for the sysinfo plugin.
      Closes: #845940
    + Have hexchat recommend the hexchat-otr plugin.
      Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com> for the suggestion
    + Bump the Breaks/Replaces of hexchat-plugins against hexchat;
      hexchat-plugin.pc has been moved from hexchat to hexchat-plugins
      in 2.12.0-1.  LP: #1586239
    + Set appropriate Breaks/Replaces to cope with the Ubuntu delta and
      make the package syncable.
    + Mark hexchat-common as Multi-Arch:foreign (from the m-a hinter).
  * debian/rules:
    + Remove huge override_dh_auto_clean: if anything of that is needed,
      it should be done on the upstream side.
    + Remove *.la files before running dh_install.
    + Use dh_install --fail-missing.
  * Package the Lua plugin.  Closes: #834491
  * Update upstream changelog for 2.13.2.
  * Use dh_installchangelogs to install the upstream changelog, instead of
    manually compressing in rules and the install with d/*.docs.
  * Let the upstream build system put the manpage in place, instead of copying
    it of our own.
  * Add patch to properly clean the upstream sources and make possible to build
    the package twice in a row.
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 10.
    + --with autoreconf is now default.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Make it DEP-5 compliant.
    + Update.
  * Drop nearly all lintian overrides; they are either fixed or unused.
